## Welcome to your Bucket List bidding system!

You can use this web app to create bucket lists and turn the items in them into real vacations.

Users start out by building bucket lists. Each item in the list has a name ("Bike across France", "Hike the Annapurna", etc) and optional notes ("be sure to see / bring x" etc).

On the bucket list index page, you can see all the items in your bucket and click on any one to turn it into a vacation. After the vacation is created you can edit it to add attractions (maybe go to language school in Tours while you're in France?) and schedule details, if you like.

Future versions of this app will implement bidding, which will allow users to toggle the status of their vacation from private to "open to bids". Even when a vacation is open to bids, user details will remain private; all that bidders will see will be the list of destinations, dates, and special instructions. Bidders will be able to search vacations for particular destinations, dates, or budget amounts.


I hope you can use this free app to make your bucket list dreams come true!

## Videos

Here is a 10-minute video walkthrough of how this program works: https://www.loom.com/share/b7ba598fc12e41b6aa56a7937924dba8

If you are really bored, you can watch this screencast of me working on the project -- I solve a few problems, run into more, and don't worry... I solved the last problem shortly after I stopped recording!

## Usage

To run this program,
1. clone this repo, then run 'bundle install'.
2. run rake db:migrate to set up the database with no data.
3. (optional) If you would like to experiment with seed data, you run rake db:seed.

At any point, you can reset the database by running:
1. rake db:drop
2. rake db:migrate
3. (optional) rake db:seed

After the database is set up, run 'shotgun' in terminal and you should see this:

== Shotgun/Thin on http://127.0.0.1:9393/
Thin web server (v1.7.2 codename Bachmanity)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on 127.0.0.1:9393, CTRL+C to stop

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:9393/ and you will see the project's landing page, a login page.
Click on the link at the bottom of the page to sign up for the service.
