[ X ] make sure vacations displayed on index page are user's vacations, not all vacations

[ X ] my vacations button - should not show duplicates -- .distinct is not helping

[ X ] make sure each vacation lands in a div with its vacation-id

[ X ] add link to this vacations' url

[ X ] add  event listener, click icon to show attractions - click even number of times to hide

=======
[ X  ] add link to this vacations' url (kept it from rails)

[  ] add hover event listener, so you can see a vacation's attractions when you hover over vacation
